            <p>Queensland is our home state, and we think one of the best places to visit in Australia. Known as Australiaâ€™s sunshine state, Queensland is home to the warm sandy beaches of the Gold and Sunshine Coasts and the romantic islands of the Great Barrier Reef. Often voted as one of the best places to visit in Australia.

                The Wide Bay region of Queensland including Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, and Kâ€™gari (Fraser Island) are popular sites for beach camping in Queensland.<br>
                
                Hervey Bay is also famous for its yearly humpback whale migration and widely regarded as the whale watching capital of Queensland. The population swells during July and October each year as visitors flock to the area to view the whales.
                
                Bargara, a suburb of Bundaberg is popular year-round with families who choose to stay at one of the many resorts lining the foreshore. This township has everything for a relaxing getaway including first class restaurants and safe year-round swimming.</p>

            <p>A visit to the top end as the locals call it will have you captivated by the beauty of its rugged terrain.

                The main tourist attractions of the Northern Territory visited by thousands of tourists each year are Uluru (Ayers Rock) and Kakadu National Park. However, there is so much more to see in the Northern territory. With Darwin as our starting point, we completed an epic road trip which you can read about in our Darwin to Perth post where we got to see the stunning scenery of the Katherine Gorge and the spectacular Kimberly Ranges. A journey we will never forget.
                
                The capital Darwin has an array of attractions including the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets where you can enjoy a large selection of international dishes from over 60 stalls, to watching the sun go down with a sunset cruise on Darwin Harbour.</p>

            <p>Being the largest state in the country, West Australia takes time to fully explore. The capital Perth is also the most remote capital city in Australia and one of our favourite cities. One of the best ways to see the stunning beauty of the city is on a Swan Valley wine cruise, while sampling wines of the region. No stay in Perth would be complete without visiting the turquoise waters of the famous Cottesloe Beach, itâ€™s the perfect place to relax with a cocktail while taking in the sunset over the Indian Ocean.

               We spent 2 months travelling the length of the West Australia from Kununurra near the border of Norther Territory then across to Derby and down the coastline from Derby in the far north.  Spending time at Broome, Port Headland, Exmouth, Denham and Monkey Mia, Kalbarri, Perth, Busselton, Margaret River and Albany. Before making our way to Norseman and across the Nullarbor to South Australia.</p>
