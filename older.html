                <p>Adelaide, the capital of South Australia is a culture and foodie loverâ€™s dream. The city has a vibrant entertainment and beach scene that will leave you coming back for more. Plan to spend at least 3 days to fully take in everything it has to offer. For longer stays check our article on best weekend getaways for more travel inspiration.</p><br>

                <p>South Australia is of course well known for its wine regions such as Barossa, McLaren Vale, Clare Valley, Coonawarra, and Adelaide Hills. We had the pleasure of sampling many of the regionâ€™s wines during our 7-night cruise down the Murray River on the PS Murray Princess. This majestic sternwheeler is one of the largest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. You can read more about cruising the Murray River on our detailed cruise review of the PS Murray Princess.
                    
                    Adelaide is also the starting point for the epic rail journey on the Ghan, which will take you through the centre of Australia to Darwin.</p>

                <p>A highlight for travellers to Victoria is taking the drive along the Great Ocean Road. This journey of over 600 Km will take you through some of the most scenic coastline in Australia. Along the way you will pass through picturesque landscapes including the towering limestone stacks of the 12 Apostles plus a host of natural attractions and townships. Plan 3 days to take the trip between Torquay and Allansford.
                    
                    Other must-see places in Victoria include Phillip Island, where you can spot penguins and Sovereign Hill where you can revisit Victoriaâ€™s gold mining past.
                    
                    For those also looking to visit Tasmania, a popular choice for a self-drive Tasmania getaway is to take the Spirit of Tasmania thatâ€™s departs from Melbourne to Devonport. The ferry departs most days and provides transport for cars, caravanâ€™s, Motorhomes etc. More information on the Spirit of Tasmania fares, timetables and pricing can be found here.</p>

                <p>With the River Derwent at its heart and kunanyi / Mount Wellington rising above it, in Hobart the tranquillity of a city from a bygone era co-exists with the vibrancy of a pocket-sized modern metropolis.

                    A reinvigorated Hobart of recent times has seen the emergence of a strong cultural and foodie scene. The 19th century sandstone warehouses of Salamanca Place now serve as homes to cafÃ©s and restaurants showcasing some of the best culinary experiences.
                    
                    Salamanca Market is a must do on every itinerary. Held every Saturday, itâ€™s a showcase of food, arts and entertainment. Mt Wellington/Kunanyi is an imposing backdrop to the city and the short car journey will reward you with amazing views across the city and beyond.</p><br>
                    
                <p>The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) has been the catalyst for the emergence of a number of cultural and creative events year round. Mona itself is a must do, as is the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Making the most of the expansive Derwent Estuary, a number of cruises operate, including to Mona.
                    
                    Southern Tasmaniaâ€™s main wine producing regions include the Coal River Valley, Huon Valley and Derwent Valley. The Huon Valley is also known for fresh produce and pristine wilderness. While in the region, take the regular car ferry to Bruny Island and join an amazing wildlife cruise or discover the islandâ€™s fabulous fresh produce from cheese and oysters to wine and berries.
                    
                    Travel through the Derwent Valley west of Hobart to the town of New Norfolk sited on the Derwent River. A further 30 minute drive and youâ€™ll be at Mt Field National Park and the location of one of Tasmaniaâ€™s most outstanding nature walks and waterfalls â€“ Russell Falls!
                    
                    World Heritage listed Port Arthur Historic Site is an important reminder of our convict heritage. Interpretation on-site provides a fascinating glimpse into the harsh reality of times gone by. Today you can experience the site by day or join a ghost tour by night.</p>
