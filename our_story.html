                <p>We are team of three student of UTAS working on a KIT-202 project together

                </p>
                <h2>Our Site Theme</h2>
                <p>
                    Our website serves as a travel  straightforward blogging platform for people who wants to explore Australia.  Creating a simple, uncluttered area where people can write, tag, and view articles without interruptions is the aim.  We choose this theme because it is well-known, adaptable, and allows us to use a variety of web development ideas, such as content presentation, form management, and user interaction.  It was created with clarity and learning in mind, for both users and us developers.
                </p>
